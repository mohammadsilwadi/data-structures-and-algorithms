# Stack-Queue-Pseudo
## Challenge Summary
    PseudoQueue class will implement our standard queue interface (the two methods listed below),
    Internally, utilize 2 Stack instances to create and manage the queue

Methods:

    enqueue
        Arguments: value
        Inserts value into the PseudoQueue, using a first-in, first-out approach.
    dequeue
        Arguments: none
        Extracts a value from the PseudoQueue, using a first-in, first-out approach.h

## Approach & Efficiency
<!-- What approach did you take? Why? What is the Big O space/time for this approach? -->
- enqueue to the queue is O(1)
- dequeue from the queue is O(n)
## Solution
<!-- Show how to run your code, and examples of it in action -->
