# Singly Linked List
<!-- Short summary or background information -->
Implementation: Singly Linked Lists
## Challenge
<!-- Description of the challenge -->
- [x] Adds a new node with that value to the head.
- [x] Can successfully instantiate an empty linked list.
- [x] Can properly insert into the linked list.
- [x]The head property will properly point to the first node in the linked list.
- [x] Will return true when finding a value within the linked list that exists.
- [x] Will return false when searching for a value in the linked list that does not exist
def test_includes_False.
- [ ] Can properly return a collection of all the values that exist in the linked list



## Approach & Efficiency
<!-- What approach did you take? Why? What is the Big O space/time for this approach? -->
time=o(n)
space=o(1)
## API
<!-- Description of each method publicly available to your Linked List -->
+ insert method :Adds a new node with that value to the head of the list with an O(1) Time performance.
+ Includes method:Indicates whether that value exists as a Nodeâ€™s value somewhere within the list.
+ string : a string representing all the values in the Linked List
